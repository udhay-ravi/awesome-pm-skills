## How It Works

Skills **automatically activate** based on what you're doing:

### Building Features
```
You: "Help me build a customer feedback dashboard"

Claude activates:
✓ zero-to-launch (MVP scoping with Figma simplicity test)
✓ design-first-dev (Airbnb craft standards)
✓ ai-product-patterns (AI sentiment analysis)
✓ metrics-frameworks (what to track)
```

### Making Decisions
```
You: "Should I refactor this before shipping?"

Claude activates:
✓ strategic-build (LNO framework - Leverage/Neutral/Overhead)
✓ ship-decisions (reversible vs irreversible decisions)
✓ quality-speed (craft vs velocity tradeoffs)
```

### Getting Buy-in
```
You: "I need stakeholder approval for this feature"

Claude activates:
✓ influence-craft (power mapping and coalition building)
✓ positioning-craft (clear positioning statement)
✓ exec-comms (Amazon 6-pager format)
```

### 2. **strategic-build**
Decide what's worth building using Shreyas Doshi's LNO framework
```
"Is building [feature] strategic or tactical?"
```

### 3. **design-first-dev**
Apply Brian Chesky's craft standards when quality matters
```
"Should I polish this or ship it?"
```

### 4. **ship-decisions**
Know when to ship vs iterate more
```
"Is this ready to ship?"
```

### 5. **positioning-craft**
Communicate value clearly using April Dunford's framework
```
"How should I position this feature?"
```

## Example Workflows

### Building a New Feature

1. **Scope:** `zero-to-launch` (What's the MVP?)
2. **Strategic Check:** `strategic-build` (Is this Leverage work?)
3. **Design:** `design-first-dev` (Craft level needed?)
4. **Build:** `ai-product-patterns` (Should AI be involved?)
5. **Ship:** `ship-decisions` (Ready to launch?)
6. **Launch:** `launch-execution` (How to announce?)

### Preparing for Promotion

1. **Gap Analysis:** `career-growth` (What do I need?)
2. **Strategic Work:** `strategic-pm` (How to be strategic?)
3. **Build Influence:** `influence-craft` (Get support?)
4. **Document Impact:** `exec-comms` (Write self-review?)
5. **Present Case:** `confident-speaking` (Pitch to manager?)

### Launching a Product

1. **Position:** `positioning-craft` (Who is this for?)
2. **Story:** `strategic-storytelling` (Narrative arc?)
3. **Materials:** `launch-execution` (GTM plan?)
4. **Communicate:** `exec-comms` (Stakeholder memo?)
5. **Measure:** `metrics-frameworks` (Track what?)

## Pro Tips

### 1. Skills Work Together
Don't use one skill in isolation. They compound:
```
strategic-build → design-first-dev → ship-decisions
(Is it strategic? → How much craft? → Ready to ship?)
```

### 2. Reference Specific Frameworks
Be explicit when you want a particular framework:
```
"Use Shreyas Doshi's LNO framework to evaluate this"
"Apply April Dunford's positioning canvas"
"Help me write an Amazon-style 6-pager"
```

### 3. Ask for Templates
Every skill has action templates:
```
"Give me the RICE prioritization template"
"Show me the OKR format from the skill"
"What's the pre-mortem template?"
```

### 4. Explore Related Skills
Each skill suggests related skills to use next:
```
zero-to-launch → suggests: strategic-build, design-first-dev
```
