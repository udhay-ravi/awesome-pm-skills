# Stakeholder Orchestration

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Managing stakeholder relationships
- Giving or receiving feedback
- Navigating difficult conversations
- Building cross-functional trust

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Radical Candor (Source: Kim Scott)

**The Framework:**
```
Care Personally + Challenge Directly = Radical Candor

Four Quadrants:
1. Radical Candor (care + challenge) ✅
2. Ruinous Empathy (care, don't challenge)
3. Obnoxious Aggression (challenge, don't care)
4. Manipulative Insincerity (neither)
```

### 2. SBI Feedback Model

**Structure:**
- **Situation:** When/where it happened
- **Behavior:** What they did (observable)
- **Impact:** How it affected you/team

**Example:**
```markdown
"In yesterday's meeting (Situation), 
when you interrupted Sarah three times (Behavior), 
it made her feel unheard and the team uncomfortable (Impact)."
```
