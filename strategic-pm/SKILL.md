# Becoming More Strategic

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Feeling stuck in feature factory
- Wanting to be more strategic
- Moving from execution to strategy
- Communicating strategic value

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Strategic vs Tactical Work

**Strategic:**
- Why are we building this?
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it ladder to company goals?
- What's the 2-year vision?

**Tactical:**
- What features to build?
- How to build it?
- When to ship it?

### 2. Thinking in Time Horizons

**Framework:**
```
NOW (0-3 months):
- What we're shipping this quarter
- Execution focus

NEXT (3-12 months):
- What we're building toward
- Strategic choices

LATER (12+ months):
- Where we want to be
- Vision and positioning
```
