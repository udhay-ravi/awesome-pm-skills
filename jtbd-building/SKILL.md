# Jobs-to-be-Done Product Design

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Designing new features
- Understanding customer needs
- Moving beyond feature requests
- Identifying real jobs to be done

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Jobs Theory (Source: Bob Moesta, JTBD Co-Creator)

**Core Principle:**
> "People don't buy products, they hire them to make progress in their lives."

**The Job:**
- Functional: What needs to get done?
- Emotional: How do they want to feel?
- Social: How do they want to be perceived?

### 2. Forces Diagram

**Four Forces:**
```
PUSH (away from current):
- Pains with current solution
- Frustrations

PULL (toward new):
- Attraction to new solution
- Expected benefits

ANXIETY (hesitation):
- Fear of new
- "What if it doesn't work?"

HABIT (inertia):
- "Current way works okay"
- Switching cost
```

## Action Templates

### Template: JTBD Analysis

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## The Job
**When** [situation],
**I want to** [motivation],
**So I can** [expected outcome].

### Example:
When I'm planning my week,
I want to see all my commitments in one place,
So I can feel in control and not miss anything.

## Forces Analysis

### Push (Problems with Current)
- [Current pain 1]
- [Current pain 2]

### Pull (Attraction to New)
- [Desired benefit 1]
- [Desired benefit 2]

### Anxiety (Hesitations)
- [Worry 1: "What if..."]
- [Worry 2: "What if..."]

### Habit (Inertia)
- [Current habit 1]
- [Switching cost]

## Design for the Job

### Functional
[How feature helps get job done]

### Emotional
[How feature makes them feel]

### Social
[How it affects their image]

## Address Forces
- **Reduce anxiety:** [how]
- **Overcome habit:** [how]
- **Amplify pull:** [how]
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example: Milkshake Marketing (Bob Moesta)

**Wrong Question:** "How do we make better milkshakes?"
**Right Question:** "What job is the milkshake being hired for?"

**Discovery:**
- Morning commuters: Long, thick shake for entertainment during boring drive
- Parents: Quick, thin shake to feel like good parent ("I got you a treat")

**Result:** Different products for different jobs

## Key Quotes

**Bob Moesta:**
> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."

**Clayton Christensen:**
> "When we buy a product, we essentially 'hire' something to get a job done."
