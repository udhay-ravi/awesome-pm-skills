## 💡 How to Use These Skills

### Finding the Right Skills for Your Needs:

**Simply tell your AI assistant what you're working on, and it will activate the relevant skills:**

```
"I'm starting a new AI feature" 
→ zero-to-launch, ai-product-patterns, strategic-build

"I need to present to executives"
→ exec-comms, strategic-storytelling, confident-speaking

"I'm prioritizing our roadmap"
→ prioritization-craft, decision-frameworks, strategy-frameworks

"I'm measuring product-market fit"
→ user-feedback-system, metrics-frameworks, exp-driven-dev

"I'm dealing with difficult stakeholders"
→ stakeholder-craft, influence-craft, workplace-navigation

"I'm launching a new product"
→ launch-execution, positioning-craft, growth-embedded

"I need to grow my PM career"
→ career-growth, strategic-pm, influence-craft
```

### In Cursor or Claude Code:

```
"Help me build a dashboard for customer feedback"

→ Claude activates:
   • zero-to-launch (MVP scoping)
   • design-first-dev (craft standards)
   • ai-product-patterns (AI features)
   • metrics-frameworks (what to track)
```

### Skills Work Together:

```
Building → strategic-build (is this Leverage work?)
         ↓
         design-first-dev (craft level needed?)
         ↓
         ship-decisions (ready to ship?)
         ↓
         launch-execution (how to announce?)
```
