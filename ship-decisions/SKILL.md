# The Shipping Decision Matrix

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- User asks "is this ready to ship?"
- Deciding between shipping now vs iterating more
- Evaluating if "good enough" is good enough
- Balancing technical debt vs shipping speed
- Preventing perfectionism paralysis

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions (Source: Jeff Bezos, applied by Shreyas Doshi)

**One-Way vs Two-Way Doors:**
> "Some decisions are like one-way doors - hard to reverse. Most decisions are like two-way doors - easy to reverse. Don't treat all decisions the same."

**The Framework:**

**🚪 Two-Way Doors (Reversible)**
- Can be undone or changed easily
- Low cost to reverse
- Learning > being right
- **Decision speed:** FAST (hours/days)
- **Process:** Ship and iterate

**🚪 One-Way Doors (Irreversible)**
- Hard or impossible to reverse
- High cost to undo
- Need to get it right
- **Decision speed:** SLOW (weeks/months)
- **Process:** Research, debate, decide carefully

**How to Apply:**
```
Before shipping, ask:
1. "Can we reverse this decision?"
   - YES → Two-way door → Ship fast, iterate
   - NO → One-way door → Go slow, get it right

2. "What's the cost of being wrong?"
   - LOW → Ship and learn
   - HIGH → Research more

3. "Can we learn more by shipping?"
   - YES → Ship to learn
   - NO → Prototype/test first
```

**Examples:**
```
TWO-WAY DOORS (Ship Fast):
✅ Button color
✅ Copy/messaging
✅ UI layout
✅ Feature flag experiments
✅ Pricing (for small customers)

ONE-WAY DOORS (Go Slow):
⚠️ Database schema (migrations expensive)
⚠️ API contracts (breaking changes hurt users)
⚠️ Brand decisions (hard to rebrand)
⚠️ Pricing (for enterprise customers)
⚠️ Architecture (refactoring expensive)
```

### 2. The Shipping Scorecard (Source: Shreyas Doshi)

**Is It Ready?**
> "Don't ship broken products. But also don't wait for perfect. Ship when it's good enough for real users to get value."

**The 5-Check System:**

**✅ 1. Core Functionality Works**
- Happy path functions end-to-end
- User can complete main job
- No critical bugs

**✅ 2. Edge Cases Acceptable**
- Not perfect, but handled gracefully
- Errors don't break experience
- User can recover

**✅ 3. Reversible Decision**
- Can we undo or iterate?
- Is this a two-way door?
- What's the rollback plan?

**✅ 4. Learning Value > Polish Value**
- Will shipping teach us more than building more?
- Do we need real user feedback to improve?
- Is hypothetical polish valuable without data?

**✅ 5. Risk Mitigated**
- Critical failure modes addressed
- Monitoring in place
- Gradual rollout plan

**Scoring:**
```
5/5 checks → SHIP NOW
4/5 checks → SHIP TO SMALL GROUP
3/5 checks → ITERATE ONE MORE CYCLE
<3/5 checks → NOT READY
```

### 3. Technical Debt vs Shipping Speed (Source: Marty Cagan, Tobi Lutke)

**The Tradeoff:**
> "Technical debt isn't inherently bad. It's bad when it slows you down. Ship fast, pay down debt strategically."

**When to Ship with Tech Debt:**
- **Learning debt:** Need user feedback to validate approach
- **Temporary:** Planning to refactor soon anyway
- **Isolated:** Debt doesn't affect other systems
- **Value >> Debt cost:** User value gained > refactor cost

**When to Pay Down Debt First:**
- **Compounding debt:** Will make future changes harder
- **Security/Privacy:** User trust at risk
- **Platform/API:** Breaking changes expensive
- **Team velocity:** Slowing everyone down

**Framework:**
```
Assess Tech Debt:
1. What's the carrying cost?
   - Slows future features?
   - Blocks other teams?
   - Creates bugs?

2. What's the payoff of fixing?
   - Unblocks work?
   - Reduces bugs?
   - Improves velocity?

3. What's the user value of shipping now?
   - Solves immediate problem?
   - Competitive advantage?
   - Revenue impact?

Decision:
IF (user value > debt cost) → SHIP
IF (debt blocks future) → REFACTOR
IF (uncertain) → SHIP TO SMALL GROUP
```

### 4. Gradual Rollout Strategy (Source: Modern tech best practices)

**Don't Ship to Everyone at Once:**
> "The safest way to ship is gradually. Start small, monitor, expand."

**The Rollout Ladder:**

**Stage 1: Internal (1-10 users)**
- Team uses it daily
- Find obvious bugs
- Duration: 1-3 days

**Stage 2: Early Adopters (1-5% users)**
- Select forgiving users
- Eager for new features
- Provide feedback actively
- Duration: 3-7 days

**Stage 3: Broader Beta (10-25%)**
- Larger sample size
- Monitor metrics closely
- Duration: 1-2 weeks

**Stage 4: General Availability (100%)**
- All users
- Stable metrics
- Duration: Ongoing

**Rollback Plan:**
```javascript
// Feature flag implementation
if (isFeatureEnabled(user, 'new-feature')) {
  return newExperience();
} else {
  return oldExperience();
}

// Quick rollback = change flag, no deploy
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Facebook's "Move Fast" Philosophy

**Approach:** Ship fast, break things (early days)
- Two-way doors: Ship immediately
- Feature flags: Easy rollback
- Gradual rollouts: 1% → 5% → 25% → 100%

**Evolution:** "Move fast with stable infrastructure"
- One-way doors: Go slow (API, platform)
- Two-way doors: Still fast (UI, features)

---

### Example 2: Stripe's API Versioning

**Challenge:** Changing API breaks customers

**Decision:** ONE-WAY DOOR
- Treat API as contract
- Never break backwards compatibility
- Version all changes
- Support old versions forever

**Result:** Trust through stability

---

### Example 3: Tech Debt at Airbnb

**Challenge:** Ship new features vs refactor

**Decision Framework:**
- Debt blocking growth → Refactor first
- Debt isolated → Ship, refactor later
- Uncertain → Ship to 5%, measure velocity

**Result:** Strategic debt paydown, maintained velocity

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Mistake 1: Treating All Decisions Like One-Way Doors
**Problem:** Slow decision-making, perfectionism
**Fix:** Identify two-way doors, ship fast on those

### ❌ Mistake 2: Shipping Broken Core Functionality
**Problem:** "Move fast and break things" gone wrong
**Fix:** Core must work, edge cases can be rough

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Rollback Plan
**Problem:** Ship breaks, no way to undo
**Fix:** Feature flags, gradual rollout

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Compounding Tech Debt
**Problem:** Short-term speed, long-term slowdown
**Fix:** Strategic debt paydown

## Key Quotes

**Jeff Bezos (Amazon):**
> "Some decisions are consequential and irreversible - one-way doors. Make those slowly. Most decisions are reversible - two-way doors. Make those fast."

**Shreyas Doshi:**
> "The best PMs know when 'good enough' is good enough. Ship to learn, not to be perfect."

**Marty Cagan:**
> "Technical debt isn't the enemy. The enemy is debt that compounds and slows you down."

**Tobi Lutke (Shopify):**
> "Trust is built on shipping what you promise. Ship early, ship often, ship small."
