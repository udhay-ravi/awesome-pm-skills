# Persuasive Speaking

## When This Skill Activates

Claude uses this skill when:
- Preparing presentations
- Creating talking points
- Practicing pitches
- Preparing for difficult conversations

## Core Frameworks

### 1. WHAT → SO WHAT → NOW WHAT (Source: Matt Abrahams)

**Structure:**
- **WHAT:** The information/idea
- **SO WHAT:** Why it matters
- **NOW WHAT:** What to do next

**Example:**
```markdown
WHAT: "We're seeing 30% churn in month 1"
SO WHAT: "This means we're losing $500K ARR before customers see value"
NOW WHAT: "I propose we redesign onboarding this quarter"
```

### 2. Presentation Structure

**Format:**
```
1. Hook (grab attention)
2. Problem (what's wrong)
3. Solution (your proposal)
4. Evidence (why it works)
5. Call to Action (next steps)
```
